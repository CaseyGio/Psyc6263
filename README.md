# Psyc 6263: Psychometrics — Programming Resources

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Psyc 6263: Psychometrics**, a graduate-level course in the Industrial-Organizational Psychology program. This space contains programming exercises, reproducible examples, scripts, and resources used throughout the course.

## Course Description

This course introduces students to the theory and application of psychometric methods in psychological measurement. Emphasis is placed on test construction, reliability, validity, factor analysis, and classical test theory (CTT). Students will apply these concepts using programming tools (R, Google Colab) to analyze real-world and simulated data.

## 📂 **Repository Structure**  

- **📁 Datasets/** – Contains `.csv` files used for demonstrations, activities, and assignments.  
- **📁 WkX/** – Each week’s folder (e.g., `Wk2/` for Week 2) contains:  
  - Demonstrations (`.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks)  
  - Activities (`.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks)  
  - Assignments (most weeks include at least one assignment, also in `.ipynb` format)

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**  

- **R programming language** (executed within Jupyter notebooks)  
- **Google Colab** (to run `.ipynb` notebooks)  

## 🚀 **How to Use This Repository**  

1. **Open a Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab:**  
   - Open the Google Colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - A dialogue box appears, select GitHub as the 4th option on the left-hand side.
   - Type "CaseyGio" into the textbox, click somewhere else on that dialogue box for it to find my GitHub repository.
   - Identify the Wk number and find the activity/demo/assignment.
2. **Run the Code Cells** to follow along with demonstrations and complete activities/assignments.  
3. **Use the Provided Datasets** (`.csv` files) to analyze data and practice statistical methods.  
4. **Complete Assignments** and submit them via Canvas activity/assignment portals according to course instructions.
